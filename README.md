Welcome to skippy-xd!

Skippy-xd is a lightweight, window-manager-agnostic window selector on X server. With skippy, you get live-preview on your alt-tab motions; you get the much coveted expose feature from Mac; you get a handy overview of all your virtual desktops in one glance with paging mode.

Switch is similar to Alt-Tab:

Expose is inspired from Mac:

Paging shows you your entire desktop:
